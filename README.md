# Energy-Meter

# To train dataset & evaluate performance. 

Estimating value for accuracy of certain dataset by comparing test dataset with training dataset.


# Project Tasks

1)Using model evaluation metrics to evaluate modelâ€™s accuracy.

2)Measure the performance of trained model. 

3)Evaluating different Machine Learning Algorithms to identify which model is performing well.

4)To estimate the generalization accuracy of a model on the future data.
